#Create a file called mydstask.py and attempt the below questions:
# my_ds = [23, “Jane”, (560), [“Lesson”, “Maths”, {“currency” : “KES”}], 987, (76,”John”)]
#1. Print KES
my_ds = [23, "Jane", (560), ["Lesson", "Maths", {"currency" : "KES"}], 987, (76,"John")]
print(my_ds[3][2]["currency"])                                                                 
                                                                             
#2. Print 560

#3. Print Maths

#4. In the dictionary with the key currency, add another key “amount” with value 90
print(my_ds[3][2])
my_ds[3][2]['amount']=90
#5. Reverse 987 to 789 without using an inbuilt -method or Assigning 789 manually.
#     Hint: Strings can be reversed using [::]
#6. Change the name “John” to “Jane” . \
